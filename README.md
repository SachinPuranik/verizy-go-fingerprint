# Golang library for ZFM fingerprint sensors
Library implements the Interfacing for different fingerprint reader from  ZhianTec ZFM-20, ZFM-60, ZFM-70 and ZFM-100. It also works with some other models like R302, R303, R305, R306, R307, R551 and FPM10A


The verizy-go-fingerprint library allows to use ZhianTec ZFM-20, ZFM-60, ZFM-70 and ZFM-100 fingerprint sensors on the Raspberry Pi and other operating system like MacOS and Linux. Some other models like R302, R303, R305, R306, R307, R551 and FPM10A also work.

**Note:** The library is inspired by the C++ library from Adafruit Industries:
